## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="mypic.jpg">

Hi! I am a junior at Indiana University studying Computer Science, with minors in Math and Data Science.

## Interests

I'm interested in computer graphics and backend development.

## Personal
In my free time, I enjoy playing [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/sparsh-n) and badminton. Occasionally, I also go mountain biking and (very rarely) ice skating.

I also enjoy reading some of the (many) thought provoking papers from [SIGBOVIK](https://www.sigbovik.org). Give it a read if you have time :)

<!-- ## Publications
